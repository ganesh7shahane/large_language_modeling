    "Knowing about these operations are an essential part of Pytorch and is a foundation that will help to go further in the deep learning journey. \n",

    "Pytorch is in many ways an extension of NumPy with the ability to work on the GPU and these operations are very similar to what you would see in NumPy so knowing this will also allow you to quicker learn NumPy in the future.\n",

    "In pytorch, basic the datatype is tensor, which is a multidimensional array. So, we store all our encodings in tensors."
